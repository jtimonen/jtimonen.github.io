      <description>Introduction Recap of Part 1 We pick up from where we left off in Part 1. We found out that CmdStan calls the Stan services in cmdstan::command(). For example with the command-line call
mymodel.exe id=1 method=sample algorithm=hmc engine=nuts adapt engaged=1   the called service is stan::services::sample::hmc_nuts_diag_e_adapt() which then calls stan::services::util::run_adaptive_sampler() which calls stan::services::util::generate_transitions().  Note: All code pieces shown from now on in this post are adapted from https://github.com/stan-dev/stan, licenced under the new BSD licence.</description>

      <description>Introduction So, you have your Stan model written and are doing inference for it, but something weird is happening? Or maybe you want to extend Stan but don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start because the source code repositories look daunting. These are some of the possible reasons why someone might want to study the internals of Stan, and what is happening under the hood. I have for various reasons for a long time wanted to just see what is happening line-by-line.</description>
