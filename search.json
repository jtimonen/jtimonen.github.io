    "text": "So, you have your Stan model written and are doing inference for it, but something weird is happening? Or maybe you want to extend Stan but don’t know where to start because the source code repositories look daunting. These are some of the possible reasons why someone might want to study the internals of Stan, and what is happening under the hood. I have for various reasons for a long time wanted to just see what is happening line-by-line. In this post, I am going to look at how a typical program execution starts to travel through all the different libraries related to Stan, using CmdStanR as the starting point.\n\nRelationships between different libraries and various interfaces related to Stan are visualized in the above diagram. The C++ core that we study in this post is organized into three parts.\n\nCmdStan: A command-line interface to Stan\nStan: The MCMC and optimization algorithms\nStan Math: Mathematical functions and their gradients (automatic differentiation)\n\nMany higher-level interfaces, like CmdStanR and CmdStanPy, call CmdStan internally. RStan and PyStan employ different strategies that do not rely on CmdStan. A benefit of CmdStan is that it is always released simultaneously with Stan with the same version number, which means that CmdStan is always up to date. In this, post we study the most recent Stan version 2.28.2, and if the source code structure doesn’t experience dramatic changes in the near future, this post might stay relevant for future versions too."

This does two interesting things.\n\nTranspiles the Stan model to C++ code using stanc3\nCompiles the C++ code into an executable file mymodel.exe (without the .exe file suffix on Mac or Linux).\n\nWe could have used model$save_hpp_file() to save the model C++ code into mymodel.hpp if we wanted to look at that. However, we are now interested in the C++ code that doesn’t depend on the model. I would imagine that also a lot of this model-independent code has to go into the executable."

For example, the first process creates the command-line call\nmymodel.exe id=1 random seed=660816326 output file=&lt;opath&gt;.csv refresh=100 profile_file=&lt;ppath&gt;.csv method=sample save_warmup=0 algorithm=hmc engine=nuts adapt delta=0.95 engaged=1\nwhere &lt;opath&gt; and &lt;ppath&gt; are paths to some temporary CSV files on the computer. Arguments delta=0.95 and refresh=100 are things that we specified and others are defaults created by CmdStanR. You can find explanations for the command-line arguments in the CmdStan User’s Guide.\nFor other processes the id argument is 2, 3, and 4. From now on we study only one chain (the one with id=1) and next try to find the entry point in the CmdStan code that is started with the above command-line instruction."

But wait, it is actually overloaded with four different versions of it with the same name. Not to mention each of these are templated. We will not stop here to think much about why these all versions of hmc_nuts_diag_e_adapt() are needed. A very valid print debugging approach reveals that in our case, we call the fourth one, which calls the second one, which then calls the first one. There we have\nstd::vector&lt;double&gt; cont_vector = util::initialize(\n      model, init, rng, init_radius, true, logger, init_writer);\nwhere the parameter values are initialized. In initialize(), which is defined in initialize.hpp, we try most 100 random initial points, until a point where log probability and its gradient can be evaluated successfully. In our case the first try is successful. Therefore we can now think that we exist somewhere in the (unconstrained) parameter space, at a point stored in cont_vector. The next step is to call\n  util::run_adaptive_sampler(\n      sampler, model, cont_vector, num_warmup, num_samples, num_thin, refresh,\n      save_warmup, rng, interrupt, logger, sample_writer, diagnostic_writer);\nwhich we will look at next."

What it does do is it defines some attributes that all Hamiltonian samplers need.\n\n2.2.1 class attributes\nThe attributes listed as protected describe the internal state of the sampler. All Hamiltonian samplers have these attributes, and the most interesting ones of them are\n\nz_: current state of the sampler (point in parameter space)\nintegrator_: numerical integrator used to simulate the Hamiltonian dynamics\nhamiltonian_: the Hamiltonian system\nepsilon_ / nom_epsilon_: step size of the integrator\n\n\n\n2.2.2 getters\nThe above are private attributes and should not be directly accessed from the outside. Instead, there are some getter methods that can be used, for example\n  typename Hamiltonian&lt;Model, BaseRNG&gt;::PointType& z() { return z_; }\nso one could use sampler.z() to get the current point in the (unconstrained) parameter space.\n\n\n2.2.3 init_stepsize()\nThe first actual algorithm that we encouter is the init_stepsize() method of the base_hmc class, defined in base_hmc.hpp. This defines how the integrator’s initial stepsize (possibly given by user) is refined.

The change in Hamiltonian (delta_H) then determines how the nominal stepsize (nom_epsilon_) is refined, or if it is suitable so that the actual MCMC sampling can start."

It is a bit clumsy to define a model in it, but once it is done, you can easily change between different ODE solvers, visualize fitted models. You can also study whether your ODE solver is reliable in your application. This is why you can try to use coarse solvers without error control (or control with high tolerances), and see if they are potentially faster than the standard ODE solvers in Stan with default tolerances.\n\nlibrary(odemodeling)\n#&gt; Attached odemodeling 0.2.3.\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\n1 Creating a model\nAll models need to involve an ODE system of the form \\[\\begin{equation}\n    \\label{eq: ode}\n    \\frac{\\text{d} \\textbf{y}(t)}{\\text{d}t} = f_{\\psi}\\left(\\textbf{y}(t), t\\right),\n\\end{equation}\\] where \\(f_{\\psi}: \\mathbb{R}^D \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^D\\) with parameters \\(\\psi\\).

The former is denoted MAE in Timonen et. al (2023). Please refer to that paper in order to interpret the pareto_k column. Briefly we note that the Pareto-k values seem to be converging to a value smaller than 0.5, meaning that importance sampling is possible and we don’t need to run MCMC again.\n\n\n7 References\n\nTimonen, J., Siccha, N., Bales, B., Lähdesmäki, H., & Vehtari, A.
